# Largest and Smallest Number Finder

Welcome to my Largest and Smallest Number Finder program! This Java application allows users to input a list of numbers, and it will help you find the largest and smallest numbers from the input list. Additionally, the program sorts the list in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need Java installed on your system. If you don't have Java installed, you can download and install it from the official Oracle Java website: [Java Download](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the Java source code using the following command:

   `javac LargestNumber.java`

4. Run the program with the following command:

   `java LargestNumber`


## How to Use

1. When the program starts, it will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter the number of elements (size) you want in your list.

2. After entering the size, you will be asked to input the list of numbers one by one. Please enter the numbers as requested.

3. Once you've entered all the numbers, the program will display the largest and smallest numbers from the list.

4. Next, the program will sort the numbers in ascending order using Bubble Sort. The sorted list will be displayed on the screen.


## Note

- If you enter an empty list (size = 0), the program will notify you that the array is empty.

- Bubble Sort is used for simplicity in this example. For larger arrays, more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are recommended.
